COMPENDIUM is a project conceived and assembled by me, Dynamo, and my friend Omegamax. The vast majority of the work in adapting the mappacks has been done by Dynamo, whereas the hub map is largely the work of Omegamax.
The resources used in the hub map largely come from Unreal Gold, whereas the skyboxes used come from the Quake 3 skybox community pack.
The font used is the Memento Mori II-styled font made by Jimmy on Realm667. Big thanks to him and to the Memento Mori II team for it.
The menu graphics come from the NDCP megawad, in part edited and expanded by myself. Huge thanks to the authors of it as well as to the NewDoom community in general. The sounds come from the AMC TC for Eduke32, huge thanks to the AMC team for the sounds as well as for producing one of the best mods ever made for a classic FPS, you really should check it out. Thanks in particular go to JBlade35. The intermission sounds are from Street Fighter II.
Compendium was made for use with (G)ZDoom and derived ports, so massive thanks go to Randy Heit, Graf Zahl, Blzut3 and all the other programmers and administrators that helped build this great port.

This mod, being a compilation, uses content made by other mappers during the period of Doom modding that ranges from 1994 to about 2004-2005, what I refer to as the "golden era" of Doom modding. As a result it is these people that should receive the highest accolades for they are the ones that, with their effort, created not only a large amount of fun, creative maps, but also served as an example to follow for all future generations of mappers and modders.
Below is a list of people whose work has been featured in Compendium. I literally cannot thank them enough for their amazing contributions to this game's legacy.

NEODOOM
- By Daniel
- Vaccinated Edition was made by me several months before I started Compendium. I didn't really change anything but I simply removed all custom enemies and weapons. The thing is, the wad works without said custom enemies and weapons on other source ports, so... It just defaults to that.



Below is a lsit of people, groups, associations and websites whose work and contributions hav been invaluable in allowing this project to become a reality.

Big thanks go to the ZDoom forums and community, the DoomWorld forums and community, the Zandronum forums and community, the DoomWadStation site, the Idgames database, the wadsinprogress site and all the other places which cherished and documented Doom modding for so long. 
Thanks to the idgames database mantainers, both current and previous, who have ensured the preservation of Doom modding. Without idgames, we all would be living in darker times.
Thanks to Robert Larkin for having mantained the DoomWadStation site for a very long time despite the many difficulties faced along the path.
Thanks to Simon Judd (sirjuddington) and Gez for having created and mantained Slade 3, the main program that I used to create this project. Without its advanced features and .pk3 support none of this would have been possible.
Thanks to the webmasters, programmers and administrators of the ZDoom sites and source ports, without which none of this could have been even remotely imaginable. In particular thanks to wildweasel for his logo contribution and feedback/advice.
Thanks to Ty Halderman (RIP) and TeamTNT for having created the Boom source port and having contributed so much to the Doom modding scene that quantifying it alone is a hard task. You guys rock.
Thanks to those who did re-uploads and repackagings of certain mods on the Idgames archive, such as Sparky of KISS Software and The Green Herring, and whoever else I may be forgetting right now.
Thanks to all those people who gave me a ton of advice and feedback regarding this project, in particular lupinx-kassman, Doomkid, Lunick, Playe, Aquasa, Mikolah and all the others.
Thanks to the Memento Mori Team and The Innocent Crew for having established firm and effective standards early on regarding what Doom mods should strive to be. Originally Compendium was going to feature exclusively content by those people, but I got a little carried away, I guess. :P That being said, their work is definitely the main focus of this project even still.
Thanks to Mark Klem and David Shaw for having created the most legendary MIDI compositions of all time. That stuff is so good it's hard to believe sometimes.
Thanks to Jive, who, even though using different methods, also understood early on the need to document and preserve doom mods. His work has certainly been an inspiration for many in the community. May he rest in peace.
Further thanks to all those unknown people in the Skulltag/Zandronum community who released fixes (mostly for multiplayer compatibility) for a lot of the wads featured here.
Thanks to those people who put up resources on the ZDoom forums for others to use in their mods: I've made use of some very nice sky textures from there. In particular thanks to Mechadon, Bloax, abbuw and Gez. Hope I'm not forgetting anyone :)
Thanks to all the beta testers who helped me greatly in ensuring this project is (hopefully) perfectly playable from start to finish). Thanks a lot to Yagotzirck in particular.
Thanks to the Mechanix Union for advice and encouragement, and in general for being a very good team of mappers whose work has certainly been an inspiration. Thanks to Decay in particular for the support.
Thanks to Remmirath for being a great director of gangster films.
Thanks to ID Software for having created one of the best games ever and for their invaluable lessons in game design. Thanks to John Romero in particular.
Thanks to Raven Software, 3D Realms, Rogue Entertainment and all the companies that back in the day made those amazing Doom-style games, which allowed to keep this style of game alive for many years to come. I do definitely recommend to play all of the (good) Doom clones out there!
Thanks to NightFright for his Duke Nukem 3D addon compilation, which has been the main inspiration when creating this project. 
Thanks to TheUnbeholden, whose work was the base for the Brightmaps found in Compendium
Thanks to the UG community for helping us understand the importance of preservation in retro games.
Special thanks go to Zelse, Tiny, VileR and others for the support and proofreading help.

Thank YOU for playing and keeping the spirit of Doom modding alive and well. May you have pleasant gaming (and beyond) experiences ahead. May we all have more fun and more knowledge/documentation in the coming years, in gaming and beyond. May we never forget those who came before us, while always forging forward.
